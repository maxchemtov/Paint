This is a basic tool to draw with shapes.

To run it, simply run "Paint.java". The "main" method will call the rest.

The available shapes are: Rectangle, Oval, Square, Triangle, Circle, and
Line. Note that to draw a Triangle, you must click the three points where
you want the vertices to appear.

There are also tools to Move shapes, Delete shapes, Delete the last shape
drawn, Clear the canvas, and change the Colour.
